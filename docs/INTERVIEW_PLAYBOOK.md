# Ace the Salesforce FDE Final Round — Playbook

**Candidate:** Shaikat Majumdar · **Format:** 45 min, 2:1 panel (leader + FDE), remote · **Project:** `salesforce-agentforce-enterprise-bridge`

## 0. Integrity rules (read first)
- This repo is a **reference implementation**. Say so in the first 30 seconds. Panels probe; invented production claims collapse under follow-ups.
- The "4 hours → 45 seconds / 70%" figures in your idea notes are **illustrative targets, not measurements**. Use only (a) numbers you **measured** (`make bench`), (b) numbers from **real past engagements you can defend** (e.g., your résumé's 99.2% task-completion, <5-day MVPs), or (c) an explicit **model with stated assumptions** (§6).
- Never claim a Salesforce capability you have not used. Say "I built the integration pattern against a Developer Org; I haven't operated Data Cloud at customer scale."

## 2. Round-1 feedback → what to do
1. **Ambiguity vs uncertainty** → say the words aloud: *"That part was ambiguity—we resolved it by asking; this part was uncertainty—we resolved it by measuring."* (§5)
2. **Tie outcomes to ROI** → every technical slide ends with a *so-what* line (§6).
3. **Agentforce in forward-deployed work** → §7 cheat-sheet; show the manifest and External Service path.

## 4. Terminal runbook (rehearse twice; have screenshots as fallback)
```bash
# T-30 min: pre-flight
git clone https://github.com/sm2774us/salesforce-agentforce-enterprise-bridge && cd salesforce-agentforce-enterprise-bridge
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && make install
make test                       # "Required test coverage of 100% reached"
set -a; source .env; set +a     # SF_LOGIN_URL / SF_CLIENT_ID / SF_CLIENT_SECRET (never on screen!)

# On stage
make demo                       # offline: PII stripped, ACME Corp. == Acme Corporation, $25k held for approval
bridge manifest | head -40      # Agentforce action catalog + JSON schema + requiresApproval
bridge demo --live              # same flow, real Cases in the Dev Org → switch to browser, show Case list + Bridge_Audit_Log__c
BRIDGE_API_KEYS='ak=agent:AGENT,pk=jane:APPROVER' bridge serve &    # then:
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/v1/events?wait=true -H 'X-API-Key: ak' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":"erp","account_name":"Globex Ltd","severity":"high","message":"Invoice mismatch","amount_usd":25000}'
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/approvals -H 'X-API-Key: pk'                       # pending item
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/v1/approvals/<ID>/decision -H 'X-API-Key: pk' -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"approve":true}'
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/v1/events -H 'X-API-Key: ak' -d '{"bogus":1}'  # 422 schema drift → DLQ
bridge bench -n 2000            # measured throughput (offline CRM)
```
**Demo narration beats:** (1) "Email and card number never leave the bridge unredacted." (2) "Three spellings, one account." (3) "Agent proposes; Control Tower disposes—$25k waits for a different human." (4) "Every decision is a row in `Bridge_Audit_Log__c`." (5) "Kill the network → breaker opens; `/readyz` flips to 503; audit outbox replays."
**If live org fails:** say so calmly, run `make demo`, show screenshot; failing gracefully *is* the resilience story.

## 5. Ambiguity vs uncertainty — scripts
- **Ambiguity (people can answer it):** *"'Resolve disputes automatically' had three readings—auto-close, auto-refund, auto-triage. I ran a 90-minute workshop with the COO, compliance and support leads, classified each decision by reversibility and dollar impact, and produced autonomy tiers. That is why `create_case` is LOW and `create_financial_review` is HIGH."*
- **Uncertainty (only experiments answer it):** *"Whether upstream schemas would drift and how Salesforce rate limits behaved weren't knowable by asking. I time-boxed spikes: a strict contract with `extra=forbid` + DLQ, and fault injection against the client. Result: drift is caught at the edge; 429/5xx are retried with jitter, and the breaker caps blast radius."*
- **Framing sentence for any requirement:** "Is the unknown in someone's head (ambiguity) or in the world (uncertainty)? That decides workshop vs spike."

## 6. Business value & ROI (model, not claim)
Formula: `Savings/yr = alerts/yr × (manual_min − assisted_min)/60 × loaded_$/hr − run_cost`.
Illustrative inputs (state them as assumptions): 20,000 alerts/yr, 25 min manual triage, 3 min human-in-loop for high-risk (~10% of alerts), ~0 for low-risk, $85/hr → manual ≈ 8,333 h; assisted ≈ 20,000×(0.1×3 min)/60 ≈ 100 h + review; savings on the order of **$600–700k/yr** before run cost. Say: *"This is the sizing model I'd validate in week one with the customer's real alert volume."*
Measured, defendable: pipeline p50 ≈ 0.4 ms / p95 ≈ 0.5 ms and ~2.5k events/s offline (excludes CRM network); 0 PII in audit payloads (tested); 100% coverage; MVP from clone to live org in under an hour.
Also quantify **risk avoided**: HITL on 100% of financial actions; full audit trail for SOX-style review.

## 7. Agentforce / Salesforce forward-deployed cheat-sheet
- **Agentforce** = agents (Agent Builder/Script) + Topics + **Actions** (Flow, Apex, Prompt Templates, External Services/MCP) grounded by the **Einstein Trust Layer** (PII masking, zero data retention, audit). My bridge is the *external action plane*: OpenAPI → External Service → Flow action → agent Action.
- **Data Cloud:** ingest (streaming/batch/zero-copy), map to **DSO → DMO**, identity resolution → Unified Profile, vector search/RAG for grounding. Mapping: `TelemetryEvent → UnifiedEvent` (DMO), `EntityResolver` (identity resolution), `VectorIndex` (vector search), zero-copy = federate Snowflake/Databricks instead of copying.
- **Integration:** OAuth 2.0 (client credentials/JWT/web-server flows), Named/External Credentials, REST/Bulk/Composite APIs, Platform Events & Pub/Sub API (gRPC), CDC, **MuleSoft** (system/process/experience API layers) for heavy orchestration.
- **FDE loop:** discover → MVP in days → harden → enable customer team → feed gaps back to product. Know the **Deployment Strategist** partnership: they own the business case; you own the build.
- **Governance:** permission sets, FLS, run-as user, Shield/event monitoring, Einstein Trust Layer.
- **Say what you haven't done** and how you'd learn it fast.

## 8. Simulated Q&A

### A. Project & architecture
**Q1. Walk me through the project in one minute.** A governed bridge: events are validated, de-duplicated, resolved to an account, PII-stripped, grounded with account-scoped context, planned (rules or LLM), then every tool call passes the Control Tower—RBAC, validation, risk gate, human approval for HIGH, execution against Salesforce, audit to `Bridge_Audit_Log__c`. Business outcome: automation of low-risk triage with provable control on high-risk actions.

**Q2. Why not let Agentforce call Salesforce directly?** It can and should for in-org data. The bridge handles what lives outside: heterogeneous sources, streaming, schema drift, enterprise-specific policy. It exposes those as governed Actions so the agent stays simple and the policy stays testable.

**Q3. Why a deterministic planner by default?** Auditable baseline, zero-cost, instant, and the fallback when the LLM is down or misbehaves. The LLM is an upgrade for ambiguous cases, never a single point of failure.

**Q4. How does grounding reduce hallucination?** The planner receives only redacted, account-scoped facts (counts, exposure, similar incidents), outputs must match registry names and JSON schemas, and invalid output is rejected twice (planner, Control Tower).

**Q5. How does this map to Data Cloud?** See §7 mapping; in production I'd replace my simulator with Streaming Ingestion/zero-copy and Data Cloud identity resolution and vector search, keeping the Action plane unchanged.

**Q6. Why FastAPI/Python?** Async I/O for connector-heavy workload, pydantic contracts, OpenAPI for free (that *is* the Agentforce External Service definition). For latency-critical paths I'd move hot loops to Rust/C++ (my background) behind the same contracts.

**Q7. Why is the vector index per account?** Tenant isolation: cross-account recall is a data-leak vector. Also bounds search cost to O(n log k) with n ≤ 100.

**Q8. Time/space complexity?** Enqueue O(1); dedupe O(1) bounded LRU; entity resolution O(1) exact, O(K) fuzzy on miss; recall O(n log k); approvals O(1). All buffers bounded (queue, DLQ, audit, history).

### B. Salesforce & Agentforce specifics
**Q9. How does Agentforce invoke your service?** Import `/openapi.json` as an External Service via a Named Credential, expose operations as Flow actions, add to the agent's topic as Actions with instructions describing when to use them. The manifest includes `requiresApproval` so topic instructions can say "tell the user it is pending".

**Q10. Why client-credentials OAuth?** Server-to-server, no interactive user; scoped to a run-as integration user with the `Bridge_Integration` permission set. For production I'd consider JWT bearer with certificate rotation.

**Q11. Where does the Einstein Trust Layer fit?** It masks PII for in-platform prompts; my redaction protects the *external* path (my LLM calls, audit, CRM writes). Defence in depth, not duplication.

**Q12. How would MuleSoft fit?** Put system APIs in front of ERP/payments, process API for the triage orchestration, and let my bridge call Mule as the integration fabric when the customer already standardises on it—don't rebuild what they own.

**Q13. Platform Events vs polling?** Platform Events/Pub-Sub or CDC for SF→bridge notifications (e.g., Case approved in-org); avoids polling and API-limit burn.

**Q14. How do you handle Salesforce API limits?** Retry with full jitter on 429/5xx, breaker, bounded queue backpressure, batching via Composite/Bulk as next step, and monitoring daily API usage via `/limits`.

**Q15. Human approval in Salesforce itself?** Today approvals are API-driven; the roadmap is a Flow/Approval Process on Case with the bridge listening via Platform Event—so approvers work in their native UI.

### C. Resilience, security, quality
**Q16. What if Salesforce is down?** Breaker opens after 5 failures, `/readyz` → 503, actions fail fast with FAILED audit entries, the audit outbox replays on recovery. Events remain bounded in queue; beyond capacity we return 429 so upstream retries.

**Q17. Duplicate or out-of-order events?** Dedupe by `event_id` (at-least-once safe). Ordering: key Kafka partitions by account in production.

**Q18. Prompt injection?** Event text is data inside delimiters; model output only proposes; allow-listed actions; schema validation; RBAC and HITL cannot be bypassed by text. Tested with disallowed-action and malformed outputs.

**Q19. How do you protect secrets?** Environment variables / GitHub Environment secrets with protection rules; masked repr; none in code or logs; CodeQL + pip-audit. Next: OIDC to cloud secret manager, short-lived creds.

**Q20. What does 100% coverage prove?** Every line/branch executed, not correctness. Correctness comes from behaviour tests (fault injection, adversarial LLM outputs, separation of duties). I treat coverage as a floor.

**Q21. Biggest weakness today?** In-memory approvals/audit outbox → single replica, lost on restart. First fix: Postgres + idempotent upsert on `Audit_Id__c`.

**Q22. How do you evaluate the LLM planner?** Golden dataset of events → expected action, run in CI nightly; metrics: action accuracy, invalid-output rate, fallback rate, approval-override rate from humans (the best signal).

**Q23. Monitoring in production?** Prometheus counters per decision, fallback/mirror failure counts, p95 latency, queue depth, DLQ size, audit pending sync; alerts on breaker open and DLQ growth.

### D. Consultative / behavioural
**Q24. Sponsor asks for "fully autonomous". Response?** Reframe to outcomes; show autonomy tiers; start with LOW-risk automation, measure override rate, expand autonomy by evidence.

**Q25. Ambiguity vs uncertainty — example?** §5.

**Q26. A stakeholder disagrees with your architecture.** Write an ADR with options/trade-offs, run a time-boxed spike if the dispute is empirical, escalate only after data. (J.P. Morgan: ADRs for audit-ready services.)

**Q27. Customer's engineers resent the "outsider".** Co-build workshops, pair on the first Action, hand over tests/runbook; success = they operate it without me (Balyasny enablement).

**Q28. Scope creep mid-MVP?** Maintain a "deviation log"; surface business deviations early with impact on timeline/risk, let the sponsor choose; architecture stays aligned via ADRs.

**Q29. Tell me about a failure.** (Prepare a real one. Structure: context, your mistake, detection, fix, systemic change.) Example frame: shipped an agent without an override-rate metric; added it, and made it a release gate.

**Q30. How do you feed back to product?** Structured field notes: friction, repro, frequency, workaround, business impact; weekly with product eng. Example gaps to cite from this build: Agentforce action retries/idempotency semantics, approval UX for external actions.

**Q31. 25–40% travel OK?** Yes (already ~35% at Balyasny/40% at J.P. Morgan).

**Q32. MVP vs scale priorities?** MVP: contract, one happy path, HITL, audit, observability. Scale: persistence, Kafka, multi-replica, rate limits, evals, DR, cost controls.

### E. Curveballs
**Q33. Design this for 10M events/day.** ~115/s average, ~1k/s peak: Kafka partitioned by account, stateless consumers on K8s HPA, Redis/Postgres for approvals, Data Cloud streaming ingestion, batched Composite writes, backpressure, tiered planners (rules first, LLM on ambiguity only for cost).

**Q34. Reduce LLM cost/latency?** Rules-first routing, prompt caching, small model for classification, cache by normalised message hash, timeouts + fallback.

**Q35. GDPR deletion?** Keep raw PII out of stores by design; audit holds redacted payloads; key by pseudonymous account key; deletion = remove CRM records + purge by key.

**Q36. Why not LangGraph here?** The flow is a fixed DAG with one decision; a framework would add weight without value. For multi-step reasoning with tool loops I'd use LangGraph (as in my `agentic-platform`), keeping the same Control Tower.

**Q37. What would you do in your first 30/60/90 days?** 30: shadow Deployment Strategist, learn product + customer environments, ship one MVP. 60: lead a delivery pod, reusable Action templates. 90: own a customer outcome end-to-end, contribute field feedback and reusable assets.

## 9. Questions to ask them
1. How do FDEs and Deployment Strategists split discovery vs build on a typical Agentforce engagement?
2. What does a successful first 90 days look like on this team?
3. Which Agentforce/Data Cloud gaps do FDEs most often feed back to product?
4. How are customer outcomes measured after handover?

## 10. Final checklist
- [ ] Repo cloned fresh; `make test` green; `.env` loaded; org logged in; Case list tab open
- [ ] Screenshots of demo + diagrams as fallback; slides ≤8
- [ ] ROI model numbers memorised with assumptions
- [ ] Two real past stories prepared (one win with metric, one failure)
- [ ] Rehearsed 15 minutes aloud, timed, twice
